SnapSync is a dynamic web-based community photo sharing app that enables users to upload and share photos with ease, automatically connecting with other users whose faces also appear in the photos. 

Sometimes, we take group pictures while attending events, but forget to share and ask about contacts. SnapSync helps prevent potential missed connections and increases connectivity instantly upon uploading images to SnapSync, without compromising convenience and privacy. 

Simply upload the pictures to SnapSync, enter the event name, and SnapSyncâ€™s AI-empowered facial recognition and tagging algorithm would compute encodings to match faces with other users registered in the SnapSync network. Event attendees featured in shared photos would receive notifications, allowing them to access their own images and connect with one another.
